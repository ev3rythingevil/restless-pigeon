          <p> Born and raised in North Georgia, my journey has brought me to New York City. I have been a person of many occupations, ranging from service work to construction, tour guiding and market research.
              Currently, I am pursuing a career in Software Design through the Flatiron School's Live program. I am very excited to grow and become skilled in the technological field!

           <h2 class="smolHead">My Coding History</h2>
           <img src="https://static8.depositphotos.com/1386061/896/i/950/depositphotos_8963639-stock-photo-handsome-nerdy-adult-using-a.jpg" alt="Computer Nerd" id='nerdImage'/> 
           <p> After an uncertain year of pandemic life, I had decided it was time for a change. Trying to support myself, having difficulty finding a job, and looking at turning thirty had me scrambling to secure my future. On a whim and with some helpful advice from a friend, I decided to try and learn to code. This lead me to places like <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a>. 
            This was the start of my coding journey. Learning a new skill while also trying to balance work and a social life hasn't been easy, but the excitement that it has brought is well worth the effort. Over the course of several months, I went from having zero understanding of computers to suddenly understanding tech for the first time in my life. The doors that have been opened because of this new knowledge will lead me to greater heights!

        <p> Besides coding, I am a person of many interests and hobbies. I spend a lot of time playing and listening to music, and can play several instruments. I am a massive nerd in many aspects, and watch a lot of virtual streamers. As I have learned to code, I've also dove into the world of computers. I spend a lot of time reading about computer parts and trying to learn how they all work. I have also assisted friends in building Personal Computers. I love gaming in all forms as well! I play a lot of table top games, and have a rather large collection. Besides table top, I also play lots of video games and am about to become an amateur streamer on Twitch.
            I also enjoy reading manga, with some of my favorites being Berserk, Hunter x Hunter, and Vagabond. When I do decide to leave my house, I love spending time outdoors. Hiking is one of my favorite activities, and I regularly go rock climbing, either at a gym or outdoors. Living in New York City, I'm lucky to have access to a great community at <a href='https://www.gp-81.com/'>GP81</a>, my local Climbing Gym. Check em out if you're ever in the city!

        <h2 class="smolHead">My Goals</h2>
        <p>Once I begin my online classes with Flatiron School, I will be dedicating my full focus to my studies. I aspire to be the best programmer I can possibly be! Starting a new career that will bring me stability and security for my future is my goal. I want to ensure that I won't have to worry as I continue to learn and grow as a person. Wish me luck on my journey!
