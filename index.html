          <p> Born and raised in North Georgia, my journey has brought me to New York City. I have been a person of many occupations, ranging from service work to construction, tour guiding and market research.
              Currently, I am pursuing a career in Software Design through the Flatiron School's Live program. I am very excited to grow and become skilled in the technological field!

           <h2 class="smolHead">My Coding History</h2>
           <img src="https://static8.depositphotos.com/1386061/896/i/950/depositphotos_8963639-stock-photo-handsome-nerdy-adult-using-a.jpg" alt="Computer Nerd" id='nerdImage'/> 
           <p> After an uncertain year of pandemic life, I had decided it was time for a change. Trying to support myself, having difficulty finding a job, and looking at turning thirty had me scrambling to secure my future. On a whim and with some helpful advice from a friend, I decided to try and learn to code. This lead me to places like <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a>. 
            This was the start of my coding journey. Learning a new skill while also trying to balance work and a social life hasn't been easy, but the excitement that it has brought is well worth the effort. Over the course of several months, I went from having zero understanding of computers to suddenly understanding tech for the first time in my life. The doors that have been opened because of this new knowledge will lead me to greater heights!

         <h2 class="smolHead">My Interests</h2>
        <p> Besides coding, I am a person of many interests and hobbies. I spend a lot of time playing and listening to music, and can play several instruments. As I have learned to code, I've also dove into the world of computers. I spend a lot of time reading about computer parts and trying to learn how they all work. I have also assisted friends in building Personal Computers. I love gaming in all forms as well! I play a lot of table top games, and have a rather large collection.</p>
